# Data Sources

This project uses the monthly average temperature data provided by the US National Climatic Data Center. The two main files used for the data are ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/temperature/mly-tmax-normal.txt, which is tempdata.txt, and ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/station-inventories/allstations.txt, which is allstations.txt. 

Running stationdatafixer.py reformats the allstations.txt data file, saving the result in stationdata.txt.
